# Peardeck-Assessment-Assignment-Checker
Script that tells you how many assignments you have on Peardeck 

NOTE:
    just install selenium and then enter your password and email in the script
    I had to change my password on peardeck because I sign in with google and didnt have one assigned
    The email is your google/teachhub/googleclassroom email
    The password is whatever you set it to
